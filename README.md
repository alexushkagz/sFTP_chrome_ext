# sFTP_chrome_ext
I made a copy of the chrome extension at

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sftp-client/jajcoljhdglkjpfefjkgiohbhnkkmipm?hl=en-GB

At the moment of creating this copy, the developer's domain was unreachable (maybe the project was abandoned), so I couldn't contact the developer for a valid license key.
That's why I did some reverse engineering and transformed the code to provide a LIFETIME TRIAL.

I used this for my personal non-commercial needs. Any violation of the author rights is at your own risk !
